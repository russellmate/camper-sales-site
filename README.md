## Camper Van Sales Site

This is my first full site project that I have taken on. It is somewhat of a real life example of a project, as I am building it as an unoffical site for a real business that I know. It is the first time that I have planned and and built a project with no prior instruction whatsoever, and so it has been a real challenge trying to find all the solutions completely on my own. 

There a some thing that are obviously unfinished. The text is just sammple text that I have used to shpw how the space will be filled. The PHP is not currently working on the email form; I am wondering whether it would make more sense to try and use Javascript to implement it instead. This is something I will return to in the futute.
